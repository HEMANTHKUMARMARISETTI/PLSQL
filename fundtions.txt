ex2: select last_name,salary,NVL(commission_pct,0),(salary*12)+(salary*12*NVL(commmission_pct,0)) AN_SAL from employees;

->NVL2:if there is a null,replace with 2nd argument,if not replace with 1st argument.

ex1:select last_name,salary,commission_pct,NVL2(commission_pct,salary+commission_pct,salary) income from employees;

->NULLIF:if 1st arg and 2nd arg are same returns null or the result is same.

ex1:select first_name,length(first_name) "exp1",
           last_name ,length(last_name) "exp2",
           NULLIF(length(first_name,last_name)) result
    from employees;

AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS:

"avg,min,max,count" using distinct keyword

        select count(distinct employee_id) from employees; //returns 107
        select count(commission_pct) from employees; //returns 35
MAX ex: select max(salary) from employees;//works for char,num..etc
MIN ex: select min(salary) from employees;//works for char,num..etc
SUM ex: select to_char(sum(salary)*12,'$99,99,999') from employees;//returns $82,96,992 works for char,num..etc
AVG ex: select avg(salary) from employees;//works for char,num..etc
