--PRACTICE 2

--Because of budget issues, the HR department needs a report that displays the last name and 
--salary of employees who earn more than $12,000. Save your SQL statement as a file named 
--lab_02_01.sql. Run your query
select last_name,salary from employees where salary>12000;

--Open a new SQL Worksheet. Create a report that displays the last name and department number 
--for employee number 176. Run the query
select last_name,department_id from employees where employee_id = 176;

--The HR department needs to find high-salary and low-salary employees. Modify 
--lab_02_01.sql to display the last name and salary for any employee whose salary is not in 
--the range of $5,000 to $12,000. Save your SQL statement as lab_02_03.sql
select last_name,salary from employees where salary not between 5000 and 12000;

-- Create a report to display the last name, job ID, and start date for the employees with the last 
--names of Matos and Taylor. Order the query in ascending order by the start date.
select last_name,job_id,hire_date from employees where last_name in('Matos','Taylor') order by 3;

--Display the last name and department number of all employees in departments 20 or 50 in 
--ascending alphabetical order by name
select last_name,department_id from employees where department_id in(20,50) order by 1;

-- Modify lab_02_03.sql to display the last name and salary of employees who earn between 
--$5,000 and $12,000, and are in department 20 or 50. Label the columns Employee and 
--Monthly Salary, respectively. Resave lab_02_03.sql as lab_02_06.sql. Run the 
--statement in lab_02_06.sql.
select last_name as Employee,salary as "Monthly Salary" 
from employees 
where salary between 5000 and 12000
and
department_id in(20,50);

--The HR department needs a report that displays the last name and hire date for all employees 
--who were hired in 1994
select last_name,hire_date from employees where hire_date like '%94';
--no data found ,because 1994 data is not available in employee table

--Create a report to display the last name and job title of all employees who do not have a manager
select last_name,job_id from employees where manager_id is null;

--Create a report to display the last name, salary, and commission of all employees who earn 
--commissions. Sort data in descending order of salary and commissions.
--Use the column’s numeric position in the ORDER BY clause
select last_name,salary,commission_pct from employees where commission_pct is not null order by salary desc;

--Members of the HR department want to have more flexibility with the queries that you are 
--writing. They would like a report that displays the last name and salary of employees who earn 
--more than an amount that the user specifies after a prompt. Save this query to a file named 
--lab_02_10.sql. If you enter 12000 when prompted, the report displays the following 
--results
select last_name,salary from employees where salary>&salary_num order by salary desc;

--The HR department wants to run reports based on a manager. Create a query that prompts the 
--user for a manager ID and generates the employee ID, last name, salary, and department for 
--that manager’s employees. The HR department wants the ability to sort the report on a selected 
--column. You can test the data with the following values
select employee_id,last_name,salary,department_id 
from employees
where manager_id=&manager_num order by &column;

--Display all employee last names in which the third letter of the name is “a.”
select last_name from employees where last_name like '__a%';

--Display the last names of all employees who have both an “a” and an “e” in their last name
select last_name from employees where last_name like '%a%' and last_name like '%e%';

--Display the last name, job, and salary for all employees whose jobs are either those of a sales 
--representative or of a stock clerk, and whose salaries are not equal to $2,500, $3,500, or $7,000
select last_name,job_id,salary from employees where job_id in('SA_REP','ST_CLERK') and salary not in(2500,3500,7000);

--Modify lab_02_06.sql to display the last name, salary, and commission for all employees 
--whose commission is 20%. Resave lab_02_06.sql as lab_02_15.sql. Rerun the 
--statement in lab_02_15.sql
select last_name as Employee,salary as "Monthly Salary",commission_pct from employees where commission_pct = 0.2;
